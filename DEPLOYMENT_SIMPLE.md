# Simple Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

Since the full application has server-side dependencies that aren't compatible with static export, here's a simplified approach for Netlify deployment:

### Option 1: Deploy Dashboard Only
1. **Create a minimal version** with just the dashboard
2. **Remove server-side dependencies**
3. **Use client-side authentication only**

### Option 2: Use Vercel Instead
For full-stack functionality, consider using **Vercel** which supports:
- ✅ Server-side rendering
- ✅ API routes
- ✅ Server actions
- ✅ Middleware
- ✅ Database connections

### Option 3: Netlify Functions
Use Netlify Functions for server-side logic:
- Convert API routes to Netlify Functions
- Use serverless functions for database operations

## 🔧 Current Issues with Static Export

The application uses:
- Server-side authentication (`currentUser()`)
- API routes (`/api/*`)
- Middleware for route protection
- Server actions and database seeding

These features require a full-stack platform like Vercel.

## 📝 Recommended Solution

**Deploy to Vercel** for full functionality:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy with full server-side support
